FIRST_WEEK_CHECKLIST.===BEGIN FIRST_WEEK_CHECKLIST=== FIRST WEEK CHECKLIST — Week 1 (5 hours, accessible-first)

Goal: Set up your environment, run first example scripts, and complete 3 small exercises so you can code comfortably with JAWS and VS Code.

      Overview (high level)
    
Time: 5 hours this week. Split into 4 sessions (2 x 1.5 hr + 2 x 1 hr) or 5 x 1 hr sessions.
Main outcomes: Python venv set up, run starter scripts (hello, fizzbuzz, calculator), open study plan and quizzes, and do 3 exercises.
Day-by-day tasks (suggested) Session 1 (1.5 hrs) — Environment and REPL

Open PowerShell. Command: cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\python-accessible-studies
Create venv: python -m venv venv
Activate venv: .\venv\Scripts\Activate
Verify Python: python --version
Open VS Code in the project folder: code .
Open study_plan.txt and README.txt in VS Code and skim with JAWS.
Session 2 (1.5 hrs) — REPL and hello script

In VS Code integrated terminal, run Python REPL: python
Try: print('Hello') and quit() to exit REPL.
Run hello script: python starter_code\hello.py
Input your name and confirm greeting.
Exercise 1: Modify hello.py to re-prompt until a non-empty name is entered. Save and run.
Session 3 (1 hr) — Loops and FizzBuzz

Run fizzbuzz: python starter_code\fizzbuzz.py
Exercise 2: Change fizzbuzz to print only numbers that are NOT fizz/buzz (i.e., print numbers not divisible by 3 or 5). Save and run.
Session 4 (1 hr) — Calculator and simple parsing

Run calculator: python starter_code\calculator.py
Exercise 3: Update calculator to catch non-numeric input and ask again (loop until two valid numbers). Save and run.
Session 5 (optional 1 hr) — Review & organize

Open quizzes/quiz_milestone1.txt and read the questions aloud with JAWS; try to answer them.
Mark completion: create a file named WEEK1_COMPLETE.txt containing date and 3-line summary of what you learned.
Commands and expected outputs (quick list)

python starter_code\hello.py -> prompts for name; prints Hello, <name>!
python starter_code\fizzbuzz.py -> prints numbers 1..100 with Fizz/Buzz rules
python starter_code\calculator.py -> prompts for two numbers and prints add/sub/mul/div
code . -> opens VS Code in project folder
python -m unittest discover -v -> runs unit tests (optional this week)
Accessibility tips (JAWS + VS Code)

Use JAWS Forms Mode when typing into the integrated terminal.
In VS Code, use the command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Toggle Accessibility Mode" if needed; the repo includes .vscode/settings.json with accessibilitySupport set to "on".
Prefer reading .txt and .csv files (study_plan.txt, quizzes/*.txt) in the editor with JAWS because they are plain text.
If you get stuck (quick fixes)

If a script says SyntaxError: check indentation and quotes; re-open file in VS Code and JAWS will read the line.
If a command 'python' is not found: ensure Python is installed and added to PATH; run python --version.
If venv activation fails: ensure you are in the project folder and run Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force, then try .\venv\Scripts\Activate again.
